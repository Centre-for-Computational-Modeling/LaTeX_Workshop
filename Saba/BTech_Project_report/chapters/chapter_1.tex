A project report is a document that describes a project’s objectives, milestones, challenges, and progress. It plays a critical role in the project planning and management process.

A project report is a document that consists of crucial information about a project. It includes information that can be used to evaluate the progress of a project, understand its objective, trace its journey, provide direction to team members, mitigate risks, and communicate a project’s success or failure to stakeholders and other business entities. \cite{Bradshaw}
