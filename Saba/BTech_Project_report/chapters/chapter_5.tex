 A project implementation plan helps with everything from development sprints and product launches to digital marketing campaigns. The project implementation plan is a critical component of project management that focuses on documenting how youâ€™ll go about a project.

Project implementation plan should include everything from project goals to deliverables and act as a blueprint for the project team to execute their plans. Every project is different and requires a unique planning and implementation plan. And since 11.4 \% of business investment is wasted because of poor project planning, companies need to ensure that their project planning and management are strategic and efficient. \cite{CJ}.
